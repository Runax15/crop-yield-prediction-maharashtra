# Crop Yield Prediction for Maharashtra

This project aims to empower farmers in Maharashtra by providing accurate predictions of crop yields. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and historical agricultural data, farmers can make informed decisions regarding crop selection, resource allocation, and farming practices. 

The accuracy rates of the machine learning algorithms are as follows:
- Linear Regression: 77.23%
- Decision Tree: 96.92%
- Random Forest: 98.15%

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Utilizes Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for crop yield prediction.
- **Dataset Integration:** Integrates temperature, rainfall, and crop datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- **Data Merging:** Combines datasets to create a final dataset with essential features.
- **Python Implementation:** Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **User-Friendly Website GUI:** Developed a website interface for farmers to input parameters such as temperature, rainfall, area, and select a district. Upon submission, the website calculates and displays the predicted crop yield, facilitating informed decision-making for farmers.
